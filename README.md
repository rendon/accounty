#Accounty: Personal accounting made easy.

Here's a quick tour (in Spanish): [Reporte de Accounty](http://rendon.x10.mx/accounty/)

Accounting is very useful because it can help us keep track of or resources, how and when each resource was spent or where a resource come from. However, accounting can be complicated, to do it well you probably need to study a career related to the subject, and that is okay because this is serious stuff.

Accounty brings accounting to your personal life, taking only a subset of the most important operations that will help you keep track of your money with a minimal knowledge of accounting, simple and easy.

Accounty is accounting, but simpler.
